Smart Agriculture Using ESP8266 and IoT is a technology-driven solution for precision farming. It utilizes an ESP8266 microcontroller to monitor environmental conditions using a capacitive soil moisture sensor and a DHT11 temperature &amp; humidity sensor. Data is displayed on an OLED screen for local visualization and transmitted via Blynk IoT alerts.
